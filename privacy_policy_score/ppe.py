# Credits: inspired by this the submodule from this repo: https://github.com/JPAntonisse/privacy-policy-evaluator
# This is the main running file for the Privacy Policy Score/Rating out of 10, the higher the score -> more concerning

# Note: the privacy policy needs to be in a .txt file
# Instructions to get the privacy policy score:
# python ppe.py evaluate "path to .txt file"
# Output: Float score ranging from 0-10

# if it doesn't work, run:
# python setup.py
# pip install sklearn
